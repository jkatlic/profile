                <h2>About Us..</h2>
                <p>The Delaware Valley Raptor Center, located in Milford, PA, is a private, not-for-profit, tax-exempt state and federally licensed rehabilitation organization dedicated to the rehabilitation and conservation of birds of prey (hawks, eagles, owls, falcons, and vultures). Our goals are to provide humane professional care for orphaned, ill, and injured raptors so they can ultimately be returned to the wild, healthly and no longer dependent upon humans for survival. We also strive to foster a greater appreciation and respect for all wildlife through public education programs and the publication of the DVRC Journal.
				</p>
                <p>The DVRC Journal is distributed to all DVRC members twice annually. It is a 16 page magazine with articles on natural history, environmental issues, raptor rehabilitation techniques, raptor profiles, timely stories including birds of  <img class="leftImg" src="img/home/baldrescue1a.jpg"/>prey in history and art, and more.
(See Featured Articles for articles from past Journal issues.)

DVRC receives no federal or state funding. Primary funding for the center comes from education programs and member donations. The center also has an adoption program and gift items for sale.

                <h2>Staff</h2>

All lab work, drug doses, external immobilization of fractures, x-rays, medicating, and day to day care of patients is provided by these 3 individuals. Surgical fixation of fractures is performed by a veterinarian trained for avian surgery. Occasional consults for eye disease are provided by a local ophthamalogist.
