                        In 1985, a call was placed that saved the life of one of the most magnificent animals found on earth. It was a golden eagle and she was on the ground, unable to fly. The call had been made by the engineer on a train in Montana. He had seen this particular eagle many times before because she had picked up a peculiar habit, that of hopping trains. Energy conservation is of utmost importance for raptors since many die of starvation each year. The more energy spent trying to catch food, the less that particular item adds to the bird’s energy store. Therefore, raptors have evolved various techniques to reduce their energy loss. For example, bald eagles often skip a day of hunting when there is no wind, waiting for a more windy day to let the air currents carry them to the lake to catch a fish and back up to a tree to eat it. In this way, they do not have to flap as much, which would mean using more of their own energy to propel themselves. Ospreys carry their fish so that it is parallel to their direction of flight, creating less drag as they fly to a perch to eat. DVRC’s resident golden eagle found her own way to save energy. She got a ride, not on wind currents, but on a train that could cover 80 miles an hour with her having to do nothing more than hold on and balance. The train offered another benefit; it scared up prey for her, namely rabbits eating along the tracks. For all the speed, power, and hunting prowess of a golden eagle, the rabbit is also adapted to its lifestyle, that of eating whenever possible and running from predators whenever necessary. For a rabbit to live very long, it must also be good at what it does, and it is fast, can jump, zig and zag, and find its way to a hole in a very short period of time, most often quickly enough to avoid the talons of neighboring goldens. In fact, a golden eagle in the desert probably makes a kill one out of every 6 times it tries. Add a train to the picture, though, and the statistics shift.
                        </p>
                        <p>
Riding on the train, the eagle watches for a rabbit frightened by the oncoming train. The rabbit, forced to move, breaks its cover. The rabbit heads away from the train and the eagle spreads her wings and launches herself from the train, with her forward momentum already fueled by the train. The rabbit, consumed with fear of the train, may not realize that a golden is descending upon it. Regardless, the rabbit now has two threats. In any panic or fractional time of indecision, it might make just the wrong move and that is what the eagle is counting on. In fact, it had happened just that way so often that this eagle had made it a practice to ride trains, or at least this train because the engineer had seen her hunt this way repeatedly. He had nicknamed her Hobo. Unfortunately, one day, the eagle made her own wrong move and did not get clear of the train in time. She was struck by the train and landed on the ground, basically in the middle of nowhere. The engineer’s timing was perfect though as he just happened to see the accident. He made an unscheduled stop of his train so that he could call someone to pick her up.

                        <p>
She was taken to Judy Hoy, a rehabilitator in Montana, who found soft tissue damage to the eagle’s right wing -- most damaging, a severed extensor tendon. Without that tendon, she could no longer extend her wing. She was now and forever unflighted. Hobo was then placed at the Delaware Valley Raptor Center to be used in education programs. However, before she began her career as one of the most captivating and awe-inspiring of DVRC’s feathered educational staff, her name was changed to Crystal (derived from the golden eagle’s Latin name, Aquila chrysaetos). Anyone having laid eyes on her glory would know that Hobo was not befitting to her. Although obviously an all too risky way to make a living, Crystal had shown her exceptional nature and, for a while, was probably a record setter among goldens.

                        In 1985, DVRC received a two year old bald eagle. The bird was designated unreleasable by the federal government due to central nervous system(CNS) damage and was then placed at DVRC to be trained for use in our education programs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
Duck hunters were pumping tons of lead into wetlands every year using lead shot. Lead, when ingested by human and eagle alike, does brain and CNS damage. Hunters who struck, but could not retrieve their targets left injured or dead ducks loaded with poison in the environment. In addition, all of the shot that missed its target, then fell into the water became available to bottom feeding waterfowl who ate the lead shot along with whatever they were aiming to scoop up. These birds also succumbed to lead poisoning and would be found by scavengers, such as eagles, either sick or dead. Considering the fact that most raptors die in their first year (a great many from starvation), conserving energy by scavenging instead of chasing prey can make a difference of survival. Easy prey, then, attracts eagles who eat the ducks along with the lead and, over time, build up high enough levels of lead in their blood to do irreparable damage. If rescued in time, a poisoned bird can undergo a drug therapy to bind up any lead remaining in their system and prevent it from int eracting. But the CNS damage, nerve damage, cannot be repaired.

                        <p>
King Frederick II was one of the lucky eagles to be found before he reached deadly levels of lead poisoning. Although he can fly, he cannot use his right leg and foot well, is uncoordinated at landing and, without both feet, cannot successfully hunt. King Frederick is an exceptional education bird with his large size and animated personality. He lives with Crystal, DVRC's resident golden eagle, eating fish and rats, as well as the occasional roadkill provided by the PA Game Commission. Infrequently, he displays one of the well known characteristics of bald eagles, that of thievery, and will leave his own food to steal Crystal's. Otherwise, the two eagles have bonded over their thirteen years together in a flight enclosure built for them, and for eagles in rehab.
